# Greetings Panel

A panel that greets you with beautiful images. Images are fetched from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), based on the dimensions of the panel. The [Unsplash License](https://unsplash.com/license) allows this kind of distribution.

At the moment, image attribution, although optional, is not possible. If there is a greater interest in this plugin, this will be considerd.


Make sure that you have a setup that allows fetching images from `https://source.unsplash.com`.
